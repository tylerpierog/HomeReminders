# 🏡 HomeReminders (🚧🏗️👷‍♂️)

An **iOS SwiftUI app** that helps you stay on top of home maintenance — cleaning, repairs, filter changes, and more.  
It sends timely reminders so your home always runs smoothly.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Rule-based recurring tasks**  
  Schedule common home chores once and automate reminders  
  _(e.g. change furnace filters, clean gutters, flush water heater)._

- 🧩 **Nominal AI-free flow**  
  All task generation is transparent and rule-driven — no black-box assistants.

- 🎨 **Clean & responsive UI**  
  Elegant SwiftUI layout with modern animations, skeleton loading,  
  and friendly messaging.

- 🔐 **Secure login/signup flow**  
  Email/password validation, inline error messaging, and smooth transitions.

- 🗂 **Auth & session flow**  
  `AppSession` state machine manages authentication  
  and drives navigation into your dashboard via `TabView`.

- 📴 **Offline-first architecture**  
  Works fully without network access — ideal for private and minimal setups.
